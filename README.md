OEDolphin is a plugin for OpenEmu derived from Dolphin that adds support for GameCube, Wii and the Triforce arcade board. Neither project's developers are involved in the development of OEDolphin and all inquiries regarding this project should not be directed at the OE project or the Dolphin project.

Due to the understandably high resource consumption of emulating these consoles, minimum system requirements are higher than the general requirements outlined in OpenEmu. The following represent an absolute minimum and games will not run well under these specs.

##### MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  - Mac OS X 10.7 or above
  - Intel Core 2 Duo
  - NVIDIA or AMD discrete GPU
  - 2GB RAM
